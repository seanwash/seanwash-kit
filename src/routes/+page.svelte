	<p>Welcome! I’m a software developer based out of 🏝
		<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Santa+Cruz,+CA/@36.9759548,-122.0824993,13z">Santa Cruz, CA</a>. I’ve
		been building software since early 2012, with the bulk of my experience being on the web platform. I’m currently
		building tools to empower interior designers, both big and small, at <a href="https://onsidedoor.com">SideDoor</a>.
	</p>

	<p>Before my journey with SideDoor, I co-hosted the <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/does-not-compute">Does Not
		Compute</a> podcast, built <a href="https://designkollective.com">Design Kollective</a>, led projects as an
		Engineering Lead at <a href="https://metalab.com">MetaLab</a>, and was the lead developer at
		<a href="https://octopuscreative.com">Octopus Creative</a>.</p>

	<p>You can find me on <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/seanwashbot">Last.fm</a> and
